## WPGet Elementor Widgets

This is a WordPress plugin for Elementor Widgets. I created this for learning how to create and manage Elementor Widgets.
Please feel free to use this as you please.

This plugin comes with no support or guarantees

## Concept
This plugin is for learning how to develop Elementor plugin addons. 

All code is not minified or uglified. 

Plugin Modules use PSR4 Autoloading. To create a new Module:
- create a folder under src/Modules
- Create a class called Module_Controller
- Module_Controller is a Singleton, see one of the existing Modules for structure.

## Current Widgets:

### Basic Scroll Sequence
